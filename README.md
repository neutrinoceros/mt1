n bodies scholar collaboration project in fortran90

authors : Cl√©ment Robert and Riwan Kherouf, supervised by Valery Lainey

##To do

* debug writing results.dat : y u no work already, mate ?
* verify data units consistency and that of the subroutines (careful with masses in GM and "forces" computations) 
* make basic tests on the current code :
  - check deviation for a rapidly evolving planet (Mercury or the Moon) with a 100yr back-and-forth integration to adjust time step (criterion is 100m deviation max)
  - check conservation of total energy and total angular momentum with 11 bodies (Sun + all planets + moon)

##Optional 

* write a decent Makefile (compilation is currently crudely made with a hard-to-edit shell script compil.sh)
* check conservation of (a,e,i,omega,Omega,M(t)) for a 2 bodies pb (Sun + Mercury)


##Recently done

* got initial-conditions data from pdf (in doc, table 5 and table 8) to .dat
* implemented loadIC subroutine to read from the .dat file.
* made Masses and initial condition parameter arrays in module data_planets.f90 generated by data/data_parser.py.
* finished implentation of walk subroutine.
