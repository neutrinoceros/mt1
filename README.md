##Git Memento
**get the code**
  
    $ git clone https://github.com/neutrinoceros/mt1.git

**...or *refresh* your copy**

    $ cd mt1/
    $ git pull

**run the program**

    $ cd mt1/
    $ ./compil.sh
    $ ./program

**submit your changes**
  
    $ git add [all modified files you want to submit]
    $ git commit -m "[short descritpion of the changes]"
    $ git push origin master

##To do

**mandatory**

* verify data units consistency and that of the subroutines (careful with masses in GM and "forces" computations) 
* make basic tests on the current code :
  - check deviation for a rapidly evolving planet (Mercury or the Moon) with a 100yr back-and-forth integration to adjust time step (criterion is 100m deviation max)
  - check conservation of total energy and total angular momentum with 11 bodies (Sun + all planets + moon)
* ~~get initial-conditions data from pdf (in doc, table 5 and table 8) to .dat~~
* ~~implement loadIC subroutine to read from the .dat file.~~
* ~~make Masses and initial condition parameter arrays in module data_planets.f90 generated by data/data_parser.py.~~
* ~~finish implentation of walk subroutine.~~
* ~~debug writing results.dat~~

**Optional**

* write a decent Makefile (compilation is currently crudely made with a hard-to-edit shell script compil.sh)
* check conservation of (a,e,i,omega,Omega,M(t)) for a 2 bodies pb (Sun + Mercury)
